## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Scripts: native first

Before adding a script file (`scripts/`, `bin/`, `tools/`, root `*.sh|*.py|*.mjs`) or a package script that runs one, take the first rung that works:

1. A flag or subcommand of a tool the repo already uses (`<tool> --help`).
2. Declarative config for that tool (`next.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `vitest.config.mts`, `oxfmt.config.ts`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
3. A maintained plugin for that tool.
4. A one-line package.json script that calls a native command.
5. A test in the existing runner (Vitest), for anything that asserts.
6. A custom script, only for behavior specific to this repo. Its first comment names the native rung it couldn't use and why. It has a test in the existing runner, and the PR that adds it quotes that comment.

## Code: libraries first

Before hand-writing general-purpose code, use a well-maintained library: actively released, widely adopted, typed, and a fit for this stack. Reach for one already in the dependencies first. Write custom code for domain logic and for the glue no library covers. A PR that adds a dependency says why it was picked; a PR that hand-writes something a library covers names the library and why it didn't fit.

- Chat transport and streaming state → AI SDK (`ai` and `@ai-sdk/react`'s `useChat`).
- Runtime validation → `zod` for resume data and chat inputs.
- Streaming Markdown → `streamdown` instead of a custom Markdown renderer.
